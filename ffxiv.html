                <h4>What the Game is About</h4>
                Final Fantasy XIV is set on Hydaelyn, a fictional world of diverse environments across three main continents, focused on
                the region of Eorzea. Four major city-states are featured: Gridania, in the heavily-forested Black Shroud; Ul'dah, a
                trade-centric sultanate in arid Thanalan; Limsa Lominsa, a thalassocracy found on the island of Vylbrand; and Ishgard,
                an isolationist theocracy in snowy, mountainous Coerthas. Eastward, a land bridge connects Eorzea to the other
                continents, conquered by the Garlean Empire.
            
                The game opens with a vision of the player character in battle with a masked man in black robes. The adventurer awakens
                from the vision on their journey to their starting city, Gridania, Ul'dah, or Limsa Lominsa. Returning players from
                legacy FFXIV appear in a column of light. Through odd jobs and tenacity, the adventurer joins their city's Adventurer's
                Guild, and is favorably compared to the Warriors of Light from the Sixth Astra Era, whom Louisoix saved, but whom no one
                can remember any details about. Masked men, like in the vision, make targeted attacks, and the adventurer gains aid from
                representatives of the Scions. The Player Character must work with his comrades and other adventurers throughout Eorzea to 
                protect Eorzea from the Ascians and the impending threat of the Garlean Empire. (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XIV" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

                <h4>Why I love this Game!</h4>I have loved playing this game so much that I actually have roughly 2000 hours of game play in this game. This game 
                has appealed to me because of many reasons, some of my favorite things about this game are the open world concept, the battle style of game play, the graphics, the music, and the story line of the game.
                Some of the things that I really love about this game is that you can play multiple classes and jobs with the same player, unlike other MMORPG style games where you would normally have to create a new player
                if you wanted to play as a different class or job. There are so many different paths, and story lines and side quests in this game that you can just spend hours without realizing how long you have been playing
                because the story is so good that it just draws you into it. If you enjoy Story Based RPG Games and MMOs this game will definitely be a good fit for you!</p>
