                <h4>What the Game is About</h4>
                The fairy Navi awakens Link from a nightmare in which he witnesses a man in black armor pursuing a young girl on
                horseback. Navi brings Link to the Great Deku Tree, who is cursed and near death. The Deku Tree tells Link that a
                "wicked man of the desert" cursed him and seeks to conquer the world and that Link must stop him. Before dying, the
                Great Deku Tree gives Link the Spiritual Stone of the Forest and sends him to Hyrule Castle to speak with Hyrule's
                princess.
                
                At the Hyrule Castle garden, Link meets Princess Zelda, who believes Ganondorf, the evil Gerudo king, is seeking the
                Triforce, a holy relic that gives its holder godlike power. Zelda asks Link to obtain the three Spiritual Stones so he
                can enter the Sacred Realm and claim the Triforce before Ganondorf reaches it. Link collects the other two stones:
                the first from Darunia, leader of the Gorons, and the second from Ruto, princess of the Zoras. Link returns to Hyrule
                Castle, where he sees Ganondorf chase Zelda and her caretaker Impa on horseback, like in his nightmare, and
                unsuccessfully attempts to stop him. Inside the Temple of Time, he uses the Ocarina of Time, a gift from Zelda, and
                the Spiritual Stones to open the door to the Sacred Realm. There he finds the Master Sword, but as he pulls it from its
                pedestal he is incapacitated and Ganondorf, having snuck into the Temple after Link, appears and claims the Triforce. Link must now
                stop Ganondorf to save Princess Zelda. (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

                <h4>Why I love this Game!</h4>I Love playing this game because I have always enjoyed Story Based RPG Style games. Ocarina of Time was one of the 
                first open world story based games that I played, being able to explore the world while completing the story and being able to go back to previously completed
                areas while playing as child Link or adult Link was something that I always liked about the game. This game also had alot of different puzzle based
            elements to it, where you had to figure out and complete puzzles to progress through the game.  </p>
